# GCR Helper

This script provisions (or verifies) a GCP service account with
permissions to push images to GCR, and loads the credentials into a
secret in your current kubernetes cluster and namespace.

By default, the following resources will be provisioned:

* A GCP service account named `push-image` with appropriate permissions.
* A Kubernetes service account (named `builder` by default) with secrets to
  enable pushing to GCR using the `push-image`'s credentials.


To use, simply add a `serviceAccountName: builder` entry to your build definition

```yaml:
apiVersion: build.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Build
metadata:
  name: mybuild
spec:
  serviceAccountName: builder
  source: ...
  template: ...
```

## Usage

```shell
# Usage assumes that the user has IAM Owner permissions for the project.
gcloud config set core/project $PROJECT_ID
gcr_helper/helper.sh
```

Optionally, `helper.sh` accepts two positional arguments to specify
the namespace and kubernetes service account used:

```shell
gcr_helper/helper.sh $MY_NAMESPACE builder-serviceaccount
```

This will output a log of operations performed or skipped:

```
